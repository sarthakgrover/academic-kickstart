- Analyzed active and passive network data from multiple homes to study network availability in various countries, popular devices in homes, and traffic usage with time.
- Monitoring system deployed on BISmark gateways to collect active and passive measurements.
- Found most home traffic is exchanged from a few devices to a small number of popular domains.
- First large scale measurement and analysis work which provides us a view of home networks behind the NAT and discusses the differences observed in kind of devices used, and the distribution of usage with time, in developed and developing countries.
- Results published at ACM SIGCOMM IMC 2013, Barcelona, Spain.
