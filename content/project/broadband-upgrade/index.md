Internet service providers are facing mounting pressure from
regulatory agencies to increase the speed of their service offerings to
consumers; some are beginning to deploy gigabit-per-second speeds in
certain markets, as well. The race to deploy increasingly faster speeds
begs the question of whether users are exhausting the capacity that is
already available. Previous work has shown that users who are already
maximizing their usage on a given access link will continue to do so when
they are migrated to a higher service tier.

In a unique controlled experiment involving thousands of Comcast subscribers in the same city, we analyzed usage patterns of two groups: a
control group (105 Mbps) and a randomly selected treatment group that
was upgraded to 250 Mbps without their knowledge. We study how users
who are already on service plans with high downstream throughput respond when they are upgraded to a higher service tier without their
knowledge, as compared to a similar control group. To our surprise, subscribers with moderate traffic demands increase their usage in response
to a service-tier upgrade relatively more than high-volume subscribers
do. We speculate that even though these users may not take advantage
of the full available capacity, the service-tier increase generally improves
performance, which causes them to use the Internet more than they otherwise would have.

- Analyzed broadband usage patterns of a user group offered higher speed broadband without their knowledge; Found that difference in traffic demand was higher for moderate users as compared to high-volume subscribers
