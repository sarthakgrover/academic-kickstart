- Developed a robust real-time face tracking algorithm using rank deficient face detection
    to iteratively search and track the human face in each video frame. 
- Demonstrated the system by mounting camera on robotic arm programmed via MATLAB.
- Potential applications include focusing on speaker
    during conferences, and recording lectures.
- Results published in proceedings of \emph{IEEE CIS 2008}.
