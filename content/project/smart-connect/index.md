- Prepared work-plan proposal for submission to the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Govt of India; Computed closed-formed expressions for network reliability, and evaluated information theoretic bounds for random hybrid networks.
- Computed closed form expressions for network reliability in hexagonal (lattice) hybrid wireless networks with link failures and fading.
- Studied tessellation algorithm for WSN drop and placement to ensure end-to-end connectivity in the wild. Proposed tier-rank based routing protocol.
- Evaluated information-theoretic bounds for random hybrid networks (Poisson RGG).
- Applications include mobile patients and equipment tracking and sensing, home health care, baby monitoring, electronic boarding passes, and lost child tracking.

- Deployed industrial wireless sensor networks and analyzed experimental data.
