## Athlete Monitoring
- Monitored inter-connectivity between players using wireless bio-medical sensors and
    multiple base stations during soccer games. Analyzed time-series experimental data
    and developed encounter based model to capture user mobility, and generate synthetic network topologies.
- Simulated encounter based real-time routing scheme for dynamic multi-hop networks.
    Applications include providing referee-assist and enhanced television broadcast services during games.
- Awarded the best student paper at \emph{IEEE WiMob 2010}, Niagara Falls, Canada (Acceptance: 28.9).
- Link to [paper](../../publication/mobility-soccer2010.pdf) on athlete monitoring

## Cross-Layer WBAN Analysis
- Implemented cross layer protocol to auto-regressively predict PHY 
    parameters and control MAC level queue for mobile nodes in Rayleigh fading environment.
- Modeled human body channel for intra BAN (on-body network). Comprehensive
    simulations on NS2 showed improved network throughput and lifetime.
- Applications include energy efficient athlete monitoring and remote health care for mobile users.
- Link to [master's thesis](../../publication/performance-WBAN2010.pdf) on performance analysis of cross layer WSNs
