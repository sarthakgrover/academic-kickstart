- Link to [Code](https://github.com/shahifaqeer/livinglab) to collect traces using soft access point.
- Offload the security of a home network to a home router.
- Fingerprint IoT devices to learn their network profile.
- Collaborate with other gateways to detect anomalous behavior.
- Simulated user behavior and captured activity periods and background traffic for 10 different IoTs.
- Use PCI and extracted relevant network features from DNS, size, timing, and frequency to identify devices. 
- Identify individual device network profiles and differentiate the behavior originating from device activities by formulating a clustering problem.
